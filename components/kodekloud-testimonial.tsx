          In the last 6 months, I have had the pleasure of editing many articles
          created by Hemanta, and I can confidently say that he is one of the
          most dedicated and hardworking writers I have ever had the pleasure of
          working with.

        <p className="mb-8 leading-7 text-slate-700">
          He is very gifted at creating engaging articles that are logically
          organized, accurate, and capturing the main point. One of his most
          outstanding qualities is the ability to create perfect examples to
          explain DevOps concepts or implementations.

        <p className="mb-16 leading-7 text-slate-700">
          His attention to detail and commitment to excellence is truly
          inspiring. Iâ€™m always looking forward to reading his articles.
