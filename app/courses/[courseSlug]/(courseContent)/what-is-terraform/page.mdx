# What is Terraform?

Software requires infrastructure to run, which includes components like servers, databases, load balancers, storage, and networking. **Terraform is a tool that helps you define, deploy, update and destroy these infrastructure components using code**. This is why Terraform is often referred to as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

In Terraform, we use a language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language** (HCL) to write our code. This code is stored in files with the `.tf` extension, commonly referred to as **Terraform configuration files**.

Terraform can provision infrastructure on major public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
In this course, we'll use AWS for two important reasons:.

- **Widely used**: According to the [2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/), AWS remains the top cloud platform, with 48% usage share among all respondents. AWS also held the number one spot in the 2023 survey, highlighting its continued popularity and importance in the tech industry.
- **Variety of services**: AWS provides a wide variety of services, ranging from storage and databases to serverless computing, and much more.
