# Introduction

Welcome to the “Terraform for Beginners” course. I'm excited to walk you through Terraform fundamentals, so that you can start using it with confidence.

This course is structured to build your knowledge progressively. Each chapter introduces new concepts that expand on the previous ones, so it's important to follow them in order.

To get the most out of this course, I encourage you to actively engage with the material. Rather than just reading through the chapters, follow along with the examples. Hands-on practice is key to reinforcing your understanding and building your skills.

Let's dive in and start exploring what Terraform has to offer!
