# Terraform state

Have you ever wondered how Terraform keeps track of your resources? How does it know which resources to create, update, or delete when you make changes to your configuration?

The answer is: the state file.

When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform creates a file named `terraform.tfstate` in the directory where you executed the command. This is the file where Terraform keeps a record of the current state of your infrastructure.

Go ahead, open the `terraform.tfstate` file. You'll see that it's structured as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) document. Within this document, the `resources` array contains a list of all the resources that Terraform manages. Each resource in this array is represented as a JSON object with various properties.

Now, what role does this state file play when you make changes to your infrastructure? Letâ€™s see: 

 - When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform reads your configuration files to understand the desired state.
 - It then compares this desired state with the current state stored in the `terraform.tfstate` file.
 - Based on this comparison, Terraform determines whether it needs to create, update, or delete resources.

**Note that the state file is solely for internal use within Terraform. You should never manually edit it or interact with it directly**.
