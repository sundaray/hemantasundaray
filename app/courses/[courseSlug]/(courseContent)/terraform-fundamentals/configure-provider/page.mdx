# Configure the provider

After specifying a provider, the next step is to configure it using a `provider` block. **Note that including a `provider` block is mandatory**.

Create a file named `providers.tf` in the `terraform-basics` folder and add the following code:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    region = "<AWS_REGION>"
}
```
Replace `<AWS_REGION>` with your specific AWS region. 

The AWS region you specify is where the resources will be deployed. For example, if you set the region to `us-east-1`, all resources defined in your Terraform configuration will be created in the US East (N. Virginia) region.

Note that the `provider` block, like the `terraform` block, sets configurations that apply to the entire Terraform project.
