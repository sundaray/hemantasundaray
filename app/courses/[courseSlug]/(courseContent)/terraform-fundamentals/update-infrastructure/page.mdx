# Update infrastructure

Inside the `main.tf` file, you have the `aws_s3_bucket` resource block that looks like this:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_course_demo" {
    bucket = “terraform-course-demo-bucket-001”
}
```

We have one argument: `bucket`. Let’s add another argument - `force_destroy` - and set its value to `true`. This is a useful configuration to have for the following reason:

If you try to delete an S3 bucket that still contains objects, AWS will throw an error. This is because AWS requires that all objects within a bucket be deleted before the bucket itself can be deleted. This is a safety measure to prevent accidental data loss.

By setting the argument `force_destroy = true`, you tell Terraform to delete all objects inside the bucket before deleting the bucket itself. This ensures that the bucket is deleted without any error.

Add the following highlighted line in the demo resource block:

```hcl {3}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_course_demo" {
    bucket = "terraform-course-demo-bucket-001"
    force_destroy = true
}
```

**Whenever you add any arguments or make changes to your Terraform code, you must run the `terraform apply` command**. This command updates your actual infrastructure to match the changes you've made in your configuration files.

Run the `terraform apply` command, and you should see the following output (image truncated for brevity):

![Terraform update output](/images/courses/terraform-for-beginners/terraform_update.jpg)

In the output, notice the tilde (~) symbol. This indicates that a resource will be updated in-place. In our case, it shows that the `force_destroy` attribute is changing from `false` to `true`. This means Terraform will modify the existing resource without recreating it.

At the bottom, you'll see a summary like `Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy`. This means Terraform will change one existing resource and won't add any new resources or destroy any existing ones.

Finally, Terraform will ask for your confirmation to proceed. Type `yes` and press Enter to apply these changes. Once confirmed, Terraform will update the resource with the new configuration.
