# Specify a provider

Terraform interacts with infrastructure platforms, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, using plugins, known as providers. You must declare which provider you require, so that Terraform can install and use them.

To specify a provider, you use a `terraform` block, which has the following syntax:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    <LOCAL_NAME> = {
      source  = "[<HOSTNAME>/]<NAMESPACE>/<TYPE>"
      version = "<VERSION>"
    }
  }
}
```

- **\<LOCAL_NAME\>**: This is a placeholder for the local name you assign to the provider. This local name is used in the rest of your Terraform configuration to refer to that specific provider. It is generally recommended to use the provider's preferred local name, so that others can easily understand your code. Nearly every provider has a preferred local name, which it uses as a prefix for all of its resource types. For example, `aws` is the preferred local name for AWS. All AWS resources begin with `aws`, such as `aws_instance` or `aws_security_group`.

- **\<URL\>**: This tells Terraform where to find and download the provider plugin. It follows the format `[<HOSTNAME>/]<NAMESPACE>/<TYPE`>. `[<HOSTNAME>/]` is the domain name of the registry where the provider is hosted. It is optional. If omitted, Terraform, by default, will download the provider from the public Terraform Registry at `registry.terraform.io`. `<NAMESPACE>` typically represents the organization that published the provider. `<TYPE>` refers to the name of the infrastructure platform the provider manages. Note that the `<TYPE>` is usually the provider's preferred local name.
- **\<VERSION\>**: This specifies which versions of the provider are acceptable for use with your Terraform configuration. It accepts a version constraint string, which can be an exact version number or a range of versions. For example, you can use `1.2.3` to specify an exact version, or `>= 1.2.0, < 2.0.0` to allow any version from `1.2.0` up to, but not including, `2.0.0`. Another common format is `~> 1.2.0`, which allows updates to the patch version only. In this case, it would allow versions like `1.2.1`, `1.2.2`, `1.2.3`, and so on, but not `1.3.0` or higher. This is useful when you want to receive bug fixes (which typically change the patch version) but avoid potentially breaking changes from minor or major version updates.

Note that the `terraform` block sets configuration options that apply to the entire Terraform project.

<Note title="What is Terraform Registry?">
Terraform Registry is a centralized hub where you can find providers, modules and policies that help you manage infrastructure as code.

Providers are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with various cloud platforms and services. Modules are reusable configuration packages that encapsulate one or more resources. Think of them as building blocks for your infrastructure. Policies are sets of rules that define what is allowed or disallowed in your Terraform configurations. They help enforce security and compliance standards.

Terraform providers are published and maintained by three main sources:

- **Official**: Developed and maintained directly by HashiCorp.
- **Partner**: Developed by HashiCorp Technology Partners, which are third-party companies that collaborate with HashiCorp to ensure that their services can be easily integrated with Terraform.
- **Community**s: Developed by individual developers.

</Note>

Now that you understand how the `terraform` block works, let's use it to specify the provider. We'll start by setting up a simple project structure:

- Create a folder named `terraform-basics`.
- Open the folder in VS Code.
- Inside this folder, create a file named `terraform.tf` and copy the following code into it:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      version = "~> 5.65.0"
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that we have specified the AWS provider version using `~> 5.65.0`. What does `~>` mean? This version constraint allows updates to the patch version only, meaning it will accept versions like `5.65.1`, `5.65.2`, and so on, but not `5.66.0` or higher. This is useful when you want to ensure compatibility by receiving bug fixes and minor improvements without introducing breaking changes from larger version updates.

At this point, you might have another question: How do I find the provider version? You can visit the [AWS provider page on the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) to check the version. This page lists the latest version and other details about the AWS provider.
