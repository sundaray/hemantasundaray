# Reference a resource attribute

When you write Terraform code, you'll often need to reference the attributes of different resources. And to reference an attribute of a particular resource, you use the following syntax:

```hcl
<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>
```
 - **\<PROVIDER\>**: This specifies the cloud provider, such as AWS (aws). 
 - **\<TYPE\>**: The type of resource, such as `s3_bucket`.
 - **\<NAME\>**: The specific name you've assigned to the resource, e.g., `terraform_course_demo`.
 - **\<ATTRIBUTE\>**: The property you want to reference, such as id.

Let's understand this by enabling EventBridge notifications on our S3 bucket. If you are not familiar with the Amazon EventBridge service, just note that itâ€™s a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier to build event-driven applications.

Add the following code in the `main.tf` file:

```hcl
# Enable EventBridge Notifications for the S3 Bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "terraform_course_demo" {
  bucket      = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_course_demo.id
  eventbridge = true
}
```
The `aws_s3_bucket_notification` resource requires a mandatory argument: `bucket`. The value assigned to the bucket needs to be the ID of the bucket. We have referenced the bucket ID using the following Terraform expression (anything that returns a value):

```hcl
aws_s3_bucket.terraform_course_demo.id
```
This expression allows Terraform to dynamically retrieve the ID of the S3 bucket you created, ensuring that the correct bucket is linked to your EventBridge notification configuration.

After adding the `aws_s3_bucket_notification` resource, run `terraform apply` to enable EventBridge notifications for your S3 bucket.
