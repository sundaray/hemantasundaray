# Create infrastructure

Now that your Terraform code is formatted and validated, you're ready to create your AWS S3 bucket. Run the following command:

```sh
terraform apply
```

After running the command, you’ll see an execution plan like this (image truncated for brevity):

![Terraform apply output](/images/courses/terraform-for-beginners/terraform_apply.jpg)

The `+` sign indicates that the resource will be created. Attributes marked as (known after apply) are those whose values will be determined only after the resource is created. For example, attributes like `arn`, `bucket_domain_name`, and `id` are generated by AWS once the S3 bucket is successfully created. Terraform cannot know these values until the resource exists.

At the bottom of the plan, you'll see a summary, such as `Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy`. This tells you how many resources will be added, modified, or deleted. Terraform will then prompt you for confirmation to proceed. Type `yes` and hit Enter and Terraform will execute the plan.

Congratulations, you've successfully created an AWS S3 bucket using Terraform!

To verify, go to the AWS S3 management console, and you should see a bucket named `terraform-course-demo-bucket-001`.

Note that the `terraform apply` command creates two files - `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup` - inside the `terraform-basics` folder. These are state files and we’ll learn more about them in the upcoming "Terraform State" section.
