# Destroy infrastructure

In Terraform, to delete the resources you have deployed, you simply run one command:

```sh
terraform destroy 
```
We have created three resources: an S3 bucket, an S3 bucket notification, and an EventBridge rule. Let's delete them. Make sure you are in the `terraform-basics` folder and then run the `terraform destroy` command.

After running this command, Terraform will generate an execution plan, similar to what you saw with `terraform apply`. This plan outlines which resources will be destroyed. You'll see a list of resources scheduled for deletion, and Terraform will prompt you for confirmation before proceeding.

Carefully review the list of resources that Terraform plans to destroy. This is your chance to ensure you're not accidentally deleting anything important. If everything looks good, type `yes` and press Enter to confirm that you want to proceed with the deletion. Terraform will then proceed to destroy the specified resources.
