# Prerequisites

Before you can deploy infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, you need:

- A code editor
- An AWS account
- Terraform installed on your system
- AWS credentials provided to Terraform

If you already have these requirements taken care of, feel free to move on to the [Terraform Fundamentals](/courses/terraform-for-beginners/terraform-fundamentals) section; otherwise, follow the instructions in the upcoming sections.
