# Create an IAM user

Sign in to your AWS account. Locate the search bar at the top of the AWS Management Console. Type "IAM" into the search bar and select the "IAM" service from the dropdown list. This will take you to the IAM console.

In the IAM console, follow these steps:

- Click **Users** in the left navigation pane.
- Click **Create user**.
- In the **User name** field, enter a descriptive name for the user (e.g., "terraform-user").
- Check the box next to **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - optional**. This will reveal a section with additional options. Under **User type**, select **I want to create an IAM user**.
- For **Console password**, choose **Autogenerated password** (recommended for security).
- Check the box next to **User must create a new password at next sign-in - Recommended**.
- Click **Next** to proceed to the **Set permissions** step, On the **Set permissions** page, under **Permission options**, choose **Attach existing policies directly**.
- Under **Permission policies**, search for and select **AdministratorAccess**. Note: The AdministratorAccess policy is an AWS managed policy that provides full access to AWS services and resources. While this is suitable for learning purposes, you should apply more restrictive permissions in real-world scenarios.
- Click **Next** to go to the **Review and create** step. On this page, review the user details and permissions.
- Click **Create user**. Youâ€™ll be taken to the **Retrieve password** step. On this page, click **Return to users list**.
