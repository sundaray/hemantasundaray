# Choose a code editor

To write Terraform code, you'll need a code editor. While you can use any code editor you prefer, I recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 

If you choose to use VS Code, I suggest installing the [Terraform extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) that provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Terraform.
