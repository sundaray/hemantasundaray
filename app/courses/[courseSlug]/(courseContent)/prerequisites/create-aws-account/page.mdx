# Create an AWS account

Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create an AWS account.

When you create an AWS account, a root user is automatically created for your account. The root user has unrestricted access to all AWS services and resources in your account and can perform any action. Therefore, as a security best practice, you should create an additional user account using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
