# Create access keys

Access keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key, which Terraform uses to authenticate API requests to AWS.

To create access keys, follow the steps below:

- Click the name of the user you created. This will take you to the user's details page.
- Click the **Security credentials** tab, then scroll to **Access keys**.
- Click **Create access key**.
- Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)** as the intended use case.
- Select the check box next to **I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key**.
- Click **Next**.
- Add a description tag for the access key (optional).
- Click **Create access key**.
- Copy the access key and the secret access key from the **Retrieve access keys** page. **Make sure to store the access key ID and secret access key somewhere safe. Youâ€™ll need these keys in an upcoming section where we configure AWS credentials for Terrafor**m.
- The access keys are also available in a downloadable CSV file. If needed, you can click **Download .csv file** to download this file.
- Click **Done**.
