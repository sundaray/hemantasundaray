OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API has a maximum input limit of **4,096 characters** per request, which is roughly equivalent to 5 minutes of audio at default speed.

So, what if you want to convert longer texts into speech?

You can follow a three-step process:

1. Split your text into smaller segments, each under 4096 characters. When splitting, ensure that sentences aren't cut off in the middle, as this could affect the coherence of the speech.
2. Send each text chunk as a separate request to the TTS API. The API will return an audio file for each chunk.
3. Merge the individual audio files into one continuous file. If you’re using Python, you can use libraries like Pydub to concatenate audio files.

When making multiple requests, be mindful of the API rate limit. Note that **the number of API requests you can make per minute depends on your usage tier**.

To check your current usage tier and the rate limits for different TTS models, log in to your OpenAI account and navigate to Settings > Organization > Limits. On this page, you’ll find all the necessary details.
