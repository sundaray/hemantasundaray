In Next.js App Router, pages are Server Components by default.
This means that if you want to add animation to your components using Framer Motion, you can't directly use the `motion` component provided by Framer Motion.
This is because the `motion` component needs access to DOM nodes to perform animations; however, Server Components in Next.js run on the server and don't have access to the DOM.

Let's explore how to solve this problem.

## The Problem

Letâ€™s say you have a component like this:

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome Home!</h1>;
}
```

This is a Server Component. When this component renders, you want to give the `h1` element an enter animation: fade in and slide up from the bottom. However, because `<HomePage>` is a Server Component, you can't directly use the corresponding `motion` component for the `h1` element, like this:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <motion.h1
      className="text-2xl font-bold"
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    >
      Welcome Home!
    </motion.h1>
  );
}
```

You'll get an error:

## The Solution

To solve this problem, you need to create a custom component that wraps the `motion` component from Framer Motion. This custom component will be a Client Component, which you can use inside Server Components.

Here's how you can create a custom component:

```tsx title="@/components/use-client.tsx"
"use client";

import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import type { HTMLMotionProps } from "framer-motion";
import React from "react";

type MotionH1Props = HTMLMotionProps<"h1">;

const MotionH1 = React.forwardRef<HTMLHeadingElement, MotionH1Props>(
  function MotionH1({ children, ...props }, ref) {
    return (
      <motion.h1 ref={ref} {...props}>
        {children}
      </motion.h1>
    );
  },
);

export { MotionH1 };
```

Let's break down what's happening in this code:

- We create a component called `<MotionH1>` using `React.forwardRef`.
- Inside `forwardRef`, we have a render function called `<MotionH1>` that takes two parameters: `props` and `ref`. We destructure the `props` parameter to extract `children`, and any remaining props using the spread operator `...props`. We then pass these props, along with the `ref`, to the `<motion.h1>` component.
- Finally, we export `<MotionH1>` to be used inside Server Components.

Now that you have an overall understanding of what the code does, let's understand more about `forwardRef`.

### Understanding forwardRef

`forwardRef` is an API in React that allows a component to expose a DOM node to its parent component with a `ref`.
In our case, `<MotionH1>` uses `forwardRef` to obtain the `ref` passed to it by Framer Motion and forward that `ref` to the underlying `<motion.h1>` component. This lets Framer Motion access the `h1` DOM node exposed by `<MotionH1>`

Now that you understand the what and why behind `forwardRef`, let's understand how to type it.

### Typing forwardRef

The syntax for `forwardRef` with TypeScript looks like this:

```tsx
const Component = React.forwardRef<RefType, PropsType>((props, ref) => {
  // Component implementation
});
```

To type `forwardRef`, you need two type parameters:

- `RefType`: Represents the type of the DOM element that the `ref` will be attached to. In our case, it's `HTMLHeadingElement` because we're rendering an `h1` element.
- `PropsType`: Represents the props that the component will receive. We define this as `MotionH1Props`, which is an alias for `HTMLMotionProps<'h1'>`.

`HTMLMotionProps` is a generic type provided by Framer Motion that represents the props for a motion component based on a specific HTML element. By passing `h1` to `HTMLMotionProps`, we're telling it to include all the valid props for an `h1` element along with motion-specific props (such as `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` ) from Framer Motion.

Now, you can import and use the `<MotionH1>` component inside the Server Component:

```tsx
import { MotionH1 } from "@/components/use-client";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <MotionH1
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      className="text-2xl font-bold"
    >
      Welcome Home!
    </MotionH1>
  );
}
```

When `<HomePage>` renders, you'll see the enter animation on the `h1` element.

But an `h1` is not the only HTML element you'll want to animate. You might also want to animate a `div`, a `section`, a `p` element, and more. In such cases, you'll have to create wrapper components for each element you want to animate, such as `MotionDiv`, `MotionSection`, `MotionP`, etc.

To keep your code organized, you can create a single file called `use-client.tsx` in your `components` folder. Inside this file, you can define all your motion component wrappers and export them.
