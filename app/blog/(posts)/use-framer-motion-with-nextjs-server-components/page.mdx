In Next.js App Router, pages are Server Components by default.
This means that if you want to add animations to your components using Framer Motion, you can't directly use the `motion` component provided by Framer Motion.

## The Problem

Letâ€™s say you have a component like this:

```tsx {2}
export function WorkExperience() {
  return <h1>Work Experience</h1>;
}
```

</BlogPostLayout>
