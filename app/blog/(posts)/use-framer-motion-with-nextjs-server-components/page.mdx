In Next.js App Router, pages are Server Components by default.
This means that if you want to add animations to your components using Framer Motion, you can't directly use the `motion` component provided by Framer Motion.
This is because the `motion` component needs access to DOM nodes to perform animations; however, Server Components in Next.js run on the server and don't have access to the DOM.

Let's explore how to solve this problem.

## The Problem

Letâ€™s say you have a component like this:

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Welcome Home!</h1>;
}
```

This is a Server Component. When this component renders, you want to give the `h1` element an enter animation: fade in and slide up from the bottom. However, because `<HomePage>` is a Server Component, you can't directly convert the `h1` to a motion component like this:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <motion.h1 initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}>
      Work Experience
    </motion.h1>
  );
}
```

This will raise an error:

## The Solution

To solve this problem, we need to create a custom motion component that wraps the `motion` component from Framer Motion. This custom component will be a Client Component, which we can use inside Server Components.

Here's how you can create a custom motion component:

```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import type { HTMLMotionProps } from "framer-motion";
import React from "react";

type MotionH1Props = HTMLMotionProps<"h1">;

const MotionH1 = React.forwardRef<HTMLHeadingElement, MotionH1Props>(
  ({ children, className, ...props }, ref) => (
    <motion.h1 ref={ref} className={className} {...props}>
      {children}
    </motion.h1>
  ),
);

MotionH1.displayName = "MotionH1";

export { MotionH1 };
```

Let's break down what's happening in this code:

```tsx
import { MotionH1 } from "@/components/motion-components";

export function WorkExperience() {
  return (
    <MotionH1
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      className="text-2xl font-bold"
    >
      Work Experience
    </MotionH1>
  );
}
```
